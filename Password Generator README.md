This Password Generator creates a randomly generated password that is 8 to 128 characters in length. The user will answer "yes" or "no" prompts that will ask them how long do they want their password to be; if they want to include upper case or lower case letters; if they want to include numbers; and if they want to include special chracters. Based on the user's input, when the "Generate Password" button is clicked, a random password will appear in the text area box.
